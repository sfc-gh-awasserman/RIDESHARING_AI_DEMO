## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: No data in results

**Solution**: Check date filters - data is from the last 12 months from TODAY

```sql
-- Verify date range
SELECT MIN(RIDE_DATE), MAX(RIDE_DATE) FROM RIDES;
```

### Issue: Views not found

**Solution**: Ensure you're in the right schema

```sql
USE DATABASE RIDESHARE_DEMO;
USE SCHEMA RIDESHARE_DATA;
SHOW VIEWS;
```

### Issue: Agent gives wrong answers

**Solution**: 
1. Verify agent has access to all 6 views
2. Check agent instructions are loaded from `agent_instructions.md`
3. Be more specific with time periods in questions

### Issue: Slow query performance

**Solution**: Use pre-aggregated views
- Use `CLIENT_PERFORMANCE_VIEW` instead of joining CLIENTS + RIDES
- Use `DRIVER_PERFORMANCE_VIEW` instead of aggregating from RIDES
- Add date filters to limit data scanned
