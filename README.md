### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

**Main Tables:**
- `CLIENTS` - School districts, agencies, and families
- `CARE_DRIVERS` - CareDrivers with certification details
- `RIDES` - Ride transactions with student types and timing
- `MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS` - Marketing campaign details
- `CAMPAIGN_RESULTS` - Campaign performance metrics
- `RIDER_FEEDBACK` - Customer feedback and ratings
- `MARKET_LEADS` - Lead tracking and conversion data

**Semantic Views:**
- `RIDESHARE_ANALYTICS_VIEW` - Comprehensive ride analytics
- `FEEDBACK_ANALYTICS_VIEW` - Feedback and sentiment analysis
- `MARKETING_ANALYTICS_VIEW` - Campaign performance and ROI
- `DRIVER_PERFORMANCE_VIEW` - Driver metrics and KPIs
- `CLIENT_PERFORMANCE_VIEW` - Client metrics and spend
- `LEAD_CONVERSION_VIEW` - Lead funnel analysis

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Snowflake account with appropriate permissions
- Access to create databases, schemas, tables, and views
- Snowflake Intelligence (Cortex Analyst) enabled in your account

### Step 1: Create Database Schema

Run the first SQL script to create the database, schema, and tables:

```sql
-- Execute in Snowflake
@01_create_database_schema.sql
```

This creates:
- Database: `RIDESHARE_DEMO`
- Schema: `RIDESHARE_DATA`
- All base tables with relationships

### Step 2: Load Synthetic Data

Run the second SQL script to populate the database with realistic synthetic data:

```sql
-- Execute in Snowflake
@02_load_synthetic_data.sql
```

This generates:
- 20 clients across multiple states
- 30 CareDrivers with various certification statuses
- 5,450+ rides spanning 12 months
- 7 marketing campaigns with results
- 1,200+ feedback entries
- 10 leads with conversion tracking

### Step 3: Create Semantic Model

Run the third SQL script to create the semantic model using YAML configuration:

```sql
-- Execute in Snowflake
@03_create_semantic_model.sql
```

This creates a comprehensive semantic model with tables, relationships, and pre-defined metrics for Snowflake Intelligence.

### Step 4: Configure Snowflake Intelligence

1. **Upload Semantic Model**: Use the semantic views as the foundation
2. **Configure Agent Instructions**: Use `agent_instructions.md` for agent behavior
3. **Reference View Descriptions**: Use `semantic_view_description.md` for view documentation
4. **Test Queries**: Start with the sample queries below

## Key Data Insights Built Into Demo

The synthetic data is designed to reveal specific insights:

### Sales Insights
- **Los Angeles** is the largest market (30% of rides)
- **Seattle** is second largest (20% of rides)
- **Texas markets** show strong growth in McKinney-Vento rides (20%+ increase in Q3 2024)
- Special needs rides represent significant revenue opportunity

### Marketing Insights
- **Social Media** is the most effective CareDriver acquisition channel
- **ROAS varies by campaign**: CareDriver recruitment campaigns show 3-4x returns
- **Geographic conversion rates**: California and Washington lead in lead-to-client conversion

### Product Insights
- **Top cancellation reasons**: Driver unavailable, weather conditions, vehicle issues
- **Wait times trending down**: Average confirmation time improved from ~25 min to ~18 min
- **Peak demand periods**: Morning rush (6-9 AM) and afternoon rush (2-5 PM)

## Using Snowflake Intelligence

### Connecting the Agent

1. Navigate to **Snowflake Intelligence** in your Snowflake account
2. Create a new agent or update existing agent
3. Configure the agent with:
   - **Database**: `RIDESHARE_DEMO`
   - **Schema**: `RIDESHARE_DATA`
   - **Semantic Views**: Select all 6 views
   - **Instructions**: Copy from `agent_instructions.md`

### Best Practices

1. **Start with broad questions** then drill down
2. **Specify time periods** for accurate results (e.g., "last 6 months", "Q3 2024")
3. **Use business terms** like "CareDriver", "McKinney-Vento", "fiscal year"
4. **Request visualizations** when appropriate (charts, heatmaps, trends)
5. **Follow up questions** to explore insights deeper

### Example Session Flow

```
You: "What are the top 5 school districts by ride volume in the last 6 months?"

Agent: [Returns ranked list with Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, Houston, Austin]

You: "For Los Angeles specifically, what's the breakdown by student type?"

Agent: [Shows distribution: 60% General, 18% Special Needs, 12% McKinney-Vento, 10% Foster Care]

You: "How does the wait time in Los Angeles compare to our other markets?"

Agent: [Compares average wait times across markets]
```

## Data Model Details

## Customization Options

### Adjusting the Data
- Modify `02_load_synthetic_data.sql` to change data volumes or distributions
- Adjust date ranges to align with your demo timeline
- Add or remove clients/drivers to match your scenario

### Extending the Schema
- Add new tables for additional features (e.g., insurance, incidents)
- Create additional semantic views for specific use cases
- Expand student types or ride categories

### Modifying Agent Behavior
- Update `agent_instructions.md` to change agent personality or focus
- Add domain-specific terminology
- Include additional business rules or constraints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No data returned:**
- Check date filters - data spans the last 12 months from current date
- Verify table names and schema references
- Confirm views are created successfully

**Slow queries:**
- Use pre-aggregated views (CLIENT_PERFORMANCE_VIEW, DRIVER_PERFORMANCE_VIEW) instead of base tables
- Add appropriate date filters
- Check for Cartesian joins in complex queries

**Agent doesn't understand question:**
- Be more specific with business terms
- Include time periods explicitly
- Break complex questions into simpler parts

## Demo Presentation Tips

### Opening
1. Introduce the business context (student transportation)
2. Explain the challenge (complex data, multiple teams, various questions)
3. Show the traditional approach (writing SQL, creating reports)
4. Introduce Snowflake Intelligence as the solution

### Core Demo
1. **Start with Sales questions** - show business value quickly
2. **Move to Marketing** - demonstrate ROI and attribution
3. **Finish with Product** - show operational insights

### Wow Moments
- Cross-functional queries (e.g., "Which marketing channel drives drivers with highest ratings?")
- Time-based comparisons (e.g., "How has X changed over time?")
- Predictive questions (e.g., "Project next quarter based on trends")
- Natural language flexibility (ask same question different ways)

### Closing
- Summarize the insights gained
- Highlight speed (minutes vs. days/weeks)
- Emphasize democratization (no SQL required)
- Show extensibility (easy to add more data sources)
